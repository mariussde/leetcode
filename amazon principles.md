* **Result:** After fixing it, response times improved by 60%, and you shared your findings with the team so others could avoid similar mistakes.

**Story 2: Investigating inconsistent bug reports**

* **Situation:** QA reported intermittent failures in a module you didn‚Äôt directly work on.
* **Task:** Help identify the root cause, even though it wasn‚Äôt your responsibility.
* **Action:** You dug into logs, test cases, and backend calls, and eventually traced the issue to a rare race condition during login.
* **Result:** Fixing it increased app reliability and you were recognized for your attention to detail.



## 5. **Are Right, A Lot**

**Story 1: Choosing the right tech stack**

* **Situation:** While leading the full app migration, you had to decide between different hosting setups and backend tech.
* **Task:** Make a decision that balanced performance, cost, and maintainability.
* **Action:** You researched options, considered the team‚Äôs strengths, and proposed a Node.js-based setup with a managed SQL service, documenting trade-offs.
* **Result:** Your decision led to faster dev cycles, and the client was happy with both performance and cost.

**Story 2: Predicting client needs**

* **Situation:** The client didn‚Äôt initially ask for analytics or monitoring.
* **Task:** Decide whether to add them.
* **Action:** You suggested basic metrics logging and uptime alerts based on experience with past issues.
* **Result:** When an issue came up later, you identified it immediately thanks to logs ‚Äî earning trust from the client.



## 6. **Insist on the Highest Standards**

**Story 1: Code quality in migration**

* **Situation:** You were reviewing code from junior developers during the app migration.
* **Task:** Ensure quality without delaying delivery.
* **Action:** You gave constructive feedback, enforced tests, and created reusable templates/components to reduce bugs.
* **Result:** Fewer regressions, and the team velocity actually improved because of better practices.

**Story 2: Testing neglected modules**

* **Situation:** Some legacy modules had little to no automated tests.
* **Task:** Improve test coverage without stalling delivery.
* **Action:** You wrote unit tests for critical logic and added regression tests for edge cases that had broken before.
* **Result:** Stability improved, and QA started spending less time on manual testing.



## 7. **Think Big**

**Story 1: Proposing app-wide changes**

* **Situation:** While leading the migration, you saw a chance to improve UX globally (e.g. consistency, responsiveness).
* **Task:** Go beyond the scope of just ‚Äúporting‚Äù the app.
* **Action:** You pitched a unified design system and performance improvements (lazy loading, caching) to stakeholders.
* **Result:** The improvements were approved, resulting in a faster, more modern app.

**Story 2: Mentoring and process**

* **Situation:** New devs joining the migration struggled with setup and standards.
* **Task:** Improve onboarding and overall efficiency.
* **Action:** You documented everything (architecture, setup, patterns) and created a shared FAQ.
* **Result:** New team members became productive faster, and the docs are still in use.



## 8. **Bias for Action**

**Story 1: Quick decision under pressure**

* **Situation:** A deployment deadline was tight, and a module wasn‚Äôt fully ready.
* **Task:** Decide whether to delay or push a partial version.
* **Action:** You made a call to temporarily disable the non-critical part behind a feature flag and shipped the rest, notifying the client in advance.
* **Result:** You hit the deadline without compromising quality, and the client appreciated the transparency.

**Story 2: Hotfix outside normal workflow**

* **Situation:** A bug in production affected a key feature, and the official process for fixes was slow.
* **Task:** Resolve the issue quickly without breaking the rules.
* **Action:** You proposed and implemented a lightweight emergency path for verified hotfixes and documented it.
